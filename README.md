# Door AR POC

POC of viewing doors on the web using Apple's AR Quick Look.

## About

In iOS 12 there is a new feature called AR Quick Look which allows users to quickly view 3D objects in AR or simply in a 3D view. This feature requires the 3D objects to be stored in the usdz formate. AR Quick Look is currently built-in to the Files, Mail, and Safari apps on iOS 12.

To obtain usdz files you can visit Apple's website using the link above or you can use Xcode 10 to convert other 3D file types to the new usdz file type.
